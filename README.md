**Pip-Boy Boot Animation**

This simple program simulates the Pip-Boy boot animation.

**Features:**

* Recreates the original boot animation from the Fallout games
* Plays the typing sound effects from the game files
* Best experienced in a retro terminal emulator like [cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term)

**Note:** This is a small, personal project, and I'm just a fan of the Fallout series. I hope you enjoy it!
